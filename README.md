# BetaValueMeta-analysis

This repository contains beta value datasets and R code associated with the article "Meta-analysis of primary producer amino acid δ<sup>15</sup>N values and their influence on trophic position estimation," currently in review at Methods in Ecology and Evolution. 

The master dataset "Beta_data.xlsx" includes beta value data, the difference between trophic and source amino acid (AA) δ<sup>15</sup>N values within primary producers, resulting from a meta-analysis of the published primary producer literature. See Metadata tab within this file for full description. 

Note: As of June 1, 2021, "Beta_data.xlsx" excludes unpublished data from Chen et al. 2020 (ice algae, n = 6) and A. C. Besser [arid habitat primary producer; freshwater eukaryotic microalgae (n = 4), grass (n = 7), forb (n = 6), cactus (n = 5), shrub (n = 6)]. Please direct data inquiries to Shaomin Chen (ice algae; shaomin.chen[at]dal.ca) or Alexi C. Besser (arid primary producer; acbesser[at]unm.edu). 

Folder "Conceptual Simulation (Fig. 1B)" includes code to reproduce Figure 1B, which is a simulation demonstrating how variation in β values and AA-specific TDFs propagate through a simple hypothetical food chain to influence consumer trophic position estimates.

Folder "Sensitivity Analysis (Fig. 5)" includes code to reproduce Figure 5, which illustrates how consumer trophic position estimates change as a function of variation in mean beta values and trophic discrimination factors. 

Note: This code produces consumer-specific results panels that were compiled by the authors using Adobe Illustrator.
